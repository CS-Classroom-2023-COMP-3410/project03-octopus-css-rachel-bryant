My development process consisted mainly of looking from the top to the bottom of the screenshot and identifying the changes that needed to be made. For example, the first change I made was changing the background color and font color of the header div, and the last change I made was styling the footer. Throughout development, I started seeing very small changes that I needed to make, such as small margin changes for various elements. 

The main challanges I faced during development were figuring out how to capitalize and bold text without altering the HTML. Previous to this project, I wasn't aware that CSS properties existed that could do these things. To solve these problems, I simply looked up the properties that I could use. I learned that I could use "text-transform: uppercase;" to capitalize text. Additionally, I learned that instead of using "font-style" to bold text, "font-weight:bold;" has to be used. 

This project was very helpful, as I learned how to use margins and padding properly. Prior to this project and class, I didn't have a proper understanding of margins and padding. I essentially thought they were the same thing. This helped me to learn when to use each property.
